# Bash scripts 

## 1. Automated backups

This Bash script automates the process of creating compressed backups (tarballs) of specified directories. It includes the current date in the backup filenames and stores them in a designated backup directory.

- Backup Automation: Easily create compressed backups of multiple directories with a single command.
- Customizable Backup Directory: Backups are stored in a designated directory for organization and easy access.
- Date Stamped Backups: Each backup filename includes the current date for quick identification of backup versions.
- Simple Usage: Just specify the directories you want to back up as arguments to the script.
```bash
./backup_script.sh /path/to/directory1 /path/to/directory2 ...
```
